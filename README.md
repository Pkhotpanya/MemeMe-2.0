# MemeMe-2.0
2nd version of MemeMe. This time we added a table to see your sent Memes.

## Description

In addition to creating Memes, this application lets you store Memes that you have sent for later viewing in a table and a collection view.
Once a meme is stored you could see a detailed view of the Meme by tapping the table cell or collection view cell.

The creation of memes is now tucked away as a modal view and is now accessed by tapping the + button on the top right corner of the application. 
This is the meme editor.

## Getting started

Ready to go.
